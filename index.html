            <h2>Mayflies have an incredibly short lifespan!</h2>
            <p>
              After the larva stage, female mayflies usually live less than five
              minutes, while males can live a whopping two days. But they don‚Äôt
              waste a single minute, spending that short period of time mating
              and reproducing.

            <p>
              Surprise! The rumors are true. Mayflies start ‚Äúhatching‚Äù from
              their water-larva state starting in May, and continue to do so
              throughout spring and summer. So, next time you see a swarm of
              these flying critters, it‚Äôs a sign that life‚Äôs about to get a
              little brighter.

            <h2>They live life to the fullest</h2>
            <p>
              Mayflies are said to have been around before dinosaurs. After more
              than 350 million years of evolution, they have perfected the art
              of life. They start as an egg, turn into a naiad, emerge from the
              water, fully mature into adults to reproduce, and then start a
              family of at least 400. And they do it all in less than two days.

            <h2>Mayflies have abs</h2>
            <p>
              All mayflies have an abdomen consisting of 10 segments. Some of
              the segments actually have operculate gills on them. So, they are
              extremely cut and amphibious ‚Äî kind of like the new Aquaman.

            <h2>Mayflies have lots of babies</h2>
            <p>
              And I mean LOTS of babies. The average female mayfly lays anywhere
              from 400 to 3,000 eggs. Typically, they are dropped on top of the
              water to develop into larva.

            <p>
              For adult mayflies, every minute is reserved for reproduction and
              feeding fish. They don‚Äôt have time to eat, so they never develop
              functional mouths. Although, in the larva state, mayflies have
              fully developed mouths, and their diet strictly consists of algae.
